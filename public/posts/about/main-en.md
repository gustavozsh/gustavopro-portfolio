I also have mastery over skills such as **Data Lakes/Lakehouses** orchestration, data modeling and architecture, technology project planning, development of automated batch/streaming data pipelines, and DevOps with **CI/CD, monitoring, and observability**.

Multi-cloud specialist certified by **Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, AWS, and IBM**. I also hold certifications including all Airflow/Astronomer certifications, Github, Oracle, Cisco, among others. I really love to study!

I love to travel, so… I never say no!

When I'm not coding, or thinking about a thousand possibilities to solve a problem, you can find me organizing tech events, speaking at conferences, events, live streams, or contributing to open source projects on GitHub. :)
